# Whisper-Santali-Asr 
Custom whisper model trained for Santali language using my santali tokenizer (https://github.com/rohitmahali01/Santali-Tokenizer)
# Current Word Error Rate is 1.28 which is good but not great
I want it to be reduced below 1 for the automatic speech recognition

# its still a work in progress
I want to complete it as soon as possible but the common voice dataset doesnt have a ton of santali audio to train on
I'm currently recording audio for the santali dataset by myself and its a time taking process
my current goal is to gather around 4 hours of audio data to train the whisper model.

## Deadlines:
## Audio Gathering - May 2025
## Testing And Finetuning - June 2025
## Deployment & Documentation - July 2025

I have uploaded my jupyter notebook for reference: (https://github.com/rohitmahali01/Whisper-Santali-Asr/blob/main/untitled16.py)
